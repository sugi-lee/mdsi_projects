## 01. Research Paper

### **PromptSense: Sentiment-Aware Mental Health Chatbot with Purpose-Oriented Prompting**

**Objective:**  
This research proposes a novel framework for mental health support chatbots that integrates sentiment and depression analysis. The system dynamically adjusts prompts based on users' emotional state, improving empathy, contextual awareness, and ethical response generation.

## 02. Deep Learning Projects

### **Food-101 Classification**  
Trained three Convolutional Neural Networks on the Food-101 dataset:  
- **GoogleNet**  
- **MobileNet**  
- **ResNet**

Objective: Compare performance across architectures and evaluate top-1 accuracy in multi-class food image classification.

### **Image Captioning**  
Implemented an encoder-decoder architecture:
- **Encoder:** CNN using ResNet
- **Decoder:** RNN-based language model

Objective: Automatically generate natural language captions from input images, combining vision and language understanding.
