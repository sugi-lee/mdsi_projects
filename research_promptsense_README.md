# PromptSense: Sentiment-Aware Mental Health Chatbot with Dynamic Prompting

## Abstract
The fast development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened great possibilities for using conversational artificial intelligence in sensitive domains such as mental health care. Despite their advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, current LLM-based mental health chatbots often lack sufficient empathy, contextual awareness, and safety mechanisms, potentially leading to ineffective or harmful interactions. Addressing these gaps, this paper proposes a novel system that integrates sentiment and depression analysis with a rule-based filtering mechanism prior to model inference. By dynamically constructing prompts based on emotional and risk-related insights, the framework aims to significantly improve the contextual relevance, empathy, and risk-aware of model-generated responses. We evaluated four model strategies (Distill Supervised Fine-Tuning (DSFT), Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF), and two Prompt Engineered variants (PE-Q and PE-P)) across qualitative metrics such as empathy, helpfulness, clarity, relevance, safety, as well as toxicity assessments using the Perspective API. Experimental results indicate that prompt engineering techniques  outperform DSFT and RLAIF by 1.8\% and 1.1\% respectively.
